# cyberpatriot-ubuntu-stuff
A simple tool for noobs working on Ubuntu for the Cyberpatriot competition.

It's pretty simple to use all you have to do is

     git clone www.github.com/antiancheta/cyberpatriot-ubuntu-stuff
     cd cyberpatriot-ubuntu-stuff
     chmod +x noobtool.sh
     sudo ./noobtool.sh
     
Should work fine after that.
